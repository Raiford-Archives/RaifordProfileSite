### About Me
My name is Raiford Brookshire. I have been working in the Software business for a couple decades now and have spent a better part of my life designing, developing and deploying some very exciting Software.

Over the past several years I have been working with Microsoft based technology
 and more specifially engineering solutions for Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. I am very enthusiastic about recent developments in the way Software is created using languages such as C# / .Net Core and integrating with Microsoft Azure as a Platform as a Service.
 
I tend to have a lot going on at any given time, but have many hobbies including traveling, hiking, music, guitar, foodie,  and cooking!


### Background
I started my Software career early on working as a Software Programmer for Loma Linda University Childrens Hospital using C++ / Delphi / Sql Server and Oracle. I was a responsible for creating a suite of Windows application used by the hospital to collect, analyse and diagnose blood samples. I was very fortunate to work on some very disciplined engineering teams including working closely with a team of Microsoft engineers learning everything I could about Design Patterns, Object Oriented Design, Enterprise Architecture and the importance of Software best practices.

TOO MUCH INFORMATION
I am an early adopter, it seems. I ran Tweak Computer Support BBS, with some success, a very long time ago. I was a FidoNet node. I have nice teeth and love cheese amongst other things. I like Tools, and I've co-written some books. I'm diabetic. I like studying Amharic and Zulu/Ndebele and listening to African Music as well as other music. I enjoy Black Hair as a hobby and can both braid and cornrow, although more recently #teamnatural. I have a podcast. I hack on hardware and waste time. I do Open Source. I have a large forefive-head. I am good at Excel and keep my resume mostly up to date for no reason. We speak Sign Language to my son and my wife speaks Ndebele. I have a great family and have had great teachers and a fantastic wedding with a great Cake Topper. I don't sleep too much. I write a lot. I'm trying to raise $50,000 for Diabetes research.

That's me, today. I'll be different tomorrow, hopefully better.
