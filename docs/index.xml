      <description>Background I started my Software career early on working as a Software Programmer for Loma Linda University Childrens Hospital using C++ / Delphi / Sql Server and Oracle. I was a responsible for creating a suite of Windows application used by the hospital to collect, analyse and diagnose blood samples. I was very fortunate to work on some very disciplined engineering teams including working closely with a team of Microsoft engineers learning everything I could about Design Patterns, Object Oriented Design, Enterprise Architecture and the importance of Software best practices.</description>
