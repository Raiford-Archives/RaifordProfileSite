Using ***C# .NET Framework w/ Visual Studio*** designed and developed an enterprise / cloud messaging application that resulted in a reusable library to interface with ***RabbitMQ***, BizTalk, and ***Service Bus*** architectures. Created a host of ***GUI Winforms*** applications and tools that were used to monitor and load test the efficiency and reliability of the various Service Buses and queuing components that also allowed us to fine tune and debug the messaging system for optimal performance in a production environment. I also designed and developed a patient financial site to allow for online payment processing and approvals in real-time using ***ASP.NET MVC / WebApi***

>Technologies include NET 4.5.2, C#, Winforms GUI,  WCF / WebApi, RabbitMQ Message Broker, AngularJS, Visual Studio 2013, ASP.NET, Dapper Data Access Library, Log4Net logging.

Design and Developed a large scale cloud based ***Video On Demand / Asset Management*** web based infrastructure that interfaces with content provider around the globe. Also create a Cloud based ***REST Web API*** to expose our system to internal development teams and partners. Created ***GUI Winforms*** applications to test the infrastructure.

####Clark County Government     2011-2012                                		      [www.clarkcountynv.gov](www.clarkcountynv.gov) 
***Azure, AWS, .NET 4.0 / 4.5, C#, ASP.NET MVC, WCF, Windows Services, Silverlight, Entity Framework, Sql Server*** was used to create an application for the Business License division. The project entailed cooperating with 4 other government entities and several consultants to make the application a reality. My role was designing and implementing the ***Azure Cloud / AWS*** based infrastructure, version control, common code Libraries, overall architecture to be used by another consulting company. Heavy multi-threading was used inside of a Windows service to provide real-time updates of business license information to a central repository implemented in cloud based  ***WCF SOAP*** interfaces. I created ***GUI Winforms/WPF Tools*** to test and monitor the backend.The project was super challenging but the end product made the entire business team very happy!


####ForgetMeNot Messaging     2009 - 2011                          			           
Developed a cloud based reusable framework that interfaces with some of the largest telecommunication devices. This was a unique project that had to interface with low level ***“C” API & SS7 Stack*** that interfaced with the hardware. I created a ***Managed .Net C++*** layer that interfaced directly to the ***“C” APIs*** then used the ***Managed C++ .Net*** classes as an interop layer that was then wrapped by a higher level C# API. I also created ***REST Api based Web Services*** that interfaced with our messaging infrastructure using ASP.NET 3.5/4.0. I also integrated our messaging system to interact with ***Facebook REST Api web services. ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server*** was used for implementation.


SmartReply Mobile Marketing	2008	    		          		           www.smartreply.com                
Designed Api architecture for a major ***SOA implementation*** using ***WCF*** and ***REST*** to expose our internal mobile messaging infrastructure to external clients. This was a large scale project that involved the entire production sales team to collaborate to meet the specific client requirements. My role was the principle architect tasked with the entire rollout. ***Window Communication Foundation (WCF)*** was used extensively to create several layers of services that are autonomous and independently deployable. This project was managed using ***AGILE SCRUM*** methodologies with daily standup and regular 3-4 week sprints. Also developed many small projects for customers using ***C#, ASP.NET, WCF, SOAP, REST, Api Webservices***.


####I have done other project based work for the following companies.



Wavetec Vision Systems	2007				               	 www.wavetecvision.com                

Designed and developed a WPF smart client Windows application that ran on a Medical device running on Windows XP Embedded. The implementation utilized C#, C++, WCF, WPF. This application was unique in that is was primarily a ‘connected’ application communicating with the company servers via WCF to share critical medical data in real-time, but had the requirement of running off-line using cached client data. I used synchronization services and Microsoft Sql Server Compact Edition to manage this process. This software also interfaced with 3 video camera / visions systems to gather measurements of the human eye and then perform complex computations to determine metrics that was then used by the doctor to perform surgeries. Although the application was written entirely in C# 3.5, I wrote an Interop Layer that interfaced with C++/C API to interface with the video cameras. It was also required to move the numerical processing code in an unmanaged DLL to meet the performance requirements.






GameFly Inc.		2007 –2008                                www.gamefly.com  / www.cheatfreak.com
 
 
Using ASP.NET 2.0 - 3.5 / GUI Winforms / WPF to develop a high performance social networking site for gamers. Site is a completely custom site using very nice CSS design / AJAX components, Data-Tier, and custom business objects. Much work was done with a data scrapping and data import functionality that pulled live data from many external sources. This site was special in that I was the only developer and had the opportunity to design and develop the entire site independently. I was tasked with interfacing with every level of management to build the requirements. It turned out very nice. Check it out. Also, wrote a suite of tools on the back end to manage the site content and data scraping.



Fandango - Movie Tickets Online	2006				       www.fandango.com
 
 
 Architected, Designed and developed major web components for the complete .NET implementation of the largest movie ticket supplier in the nation. Designed and coded re-usable ASP.NET User Controls and support classes that interface with a very complex Business/Data Access Object Tier that included custom cache objects, error handling components and transactional e-commerce components. SQL Server and Stored Procedures were used as a data store in addition to direct data feeds from theaters around the nation. Client side XHTML, XLST, and custom server side ASP.NET was used to glue the system components together. This is an ultra high traffic enterprise site that has thousands of concurrent users at any given moment that used heavy caching technologies to ensure the data loads were met. This project was completed under very heavy scrutiny by the company owners and in the end, deployment went very smooth.

When an unexpected change in leadership occurred on a project, Raiford very capably stepped in and mentored the other members of the team, communicated promptly those areas he considered at risk, both to the client as well as to me. As a result, the project moved forward with fewer interruptions and greater client satisfaction. A pleasure to work with.” 
Lesley de Lugo, Sr Account Manager, Neudesic, LLC
“I had the pleasure to work with Raiford for several months on a web services project heavily punctuated with a series of tight deadlines. He is master at engineering unlimited possibilities out of nothing - and so swift and clean that he makes complex deliverables look like cake. In a team environment he is highly collaborative, resolute and nurturing of the talents in others. Overall, Raiford hits the "A" list for team orientation, engineering savvy, work ethic, attitude and communication skills. I hope to cross project paths with him again soon.” 
 Carol Barger, Senior UI User Experience Engineer, RemoteNet Corporation
 “If you throw Raiford into the forest with nothing but a stick of gum and a band-aid, somehow he will be able to build you a rock solid application. He is the McGyver of software and web development, always finding the optimal solution given strict parameters. His creative problem solving is tempered by a solid foundation of project management, so he is able to keep a razor-sharp focus on requirements, time/budget, and results. If you are lucky enough to cross swords with Raiford, take the opportunity to work with him.”
