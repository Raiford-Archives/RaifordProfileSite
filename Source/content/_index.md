### About Me
My name is Raiford Brookshire. I have been working in the Software business for a couple decades now and have spent a better part of my life designing, developing and deploying some very exciting Software.

Over the past several years I have been working with Microsoft based technology
 and more specifially engineering solutions for Microsoft Azure Cloud Platform. I am very enthusiastic about recent developments in the way Software is created using languages such as C# / .Net Core and integrating with Microsoft Azure as a Platform as a Service.
 
I tend to have a lot going on at any given time, but have many hobbies including traveling, hiking, music, guitar, foodie,  and cooking!


### Background
I started my Software career early on working as a Software Programmer for Loma Linda University Childrens Hospital using C++ / Delphi / Sql Server and Oracle. I was a responsible for creating a suite of Windows application used by the hospital to collect, analyse and diagnose blood samples. I was very fortunate to work on some very disciplined engineering teams including working closely with a team of Microsoft engineers learning everything I could about Design Patterns, Object Oriented Design, Enterprise Architecture and the importance of Software best practices.
